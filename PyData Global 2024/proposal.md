# Deconstructing Transformers: A Visual Journey Through Layers
   
# Abstract  
  
Transformer architectures power the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), but their complexity often makes them difficult to understand. This 90-minute tutorial offers an in-depth exploration of transformers, breaking down each layer visually and conceptually to show how they convert input into output. From embeddings and positional encodings to attention mechanisms and feedforward layers, this hands-on session will guide participants through the mechanics of transformer models. Through step-by-step visualizations, you’ll process queries through transformers, analyze the role of each component, and visualize how information is transformed at every stage. By the end, you’ll have a detailed understanding of why transformers are so powerful for language tasks and how they work under the hood.

# Description  
  
Transformers are the foundation of (in vogue and powerful) LLMs like GPT, Gemini, Claude et. al., but their internal workings are often seen as a black box.  
In this 90-minute tutorial, we’ll take a deep dive into the architecture of transformers, visually deconstructing each layer for a small language model. Through a series of interactive visualizations and step-by-step breakdowns, we’ll explore embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head attention, and feedforward layers. This tutorial includes multiple coding notebooks that allow participants to process text queries through a transformer model, visualizing how the data evolves as it passes through each layer.

We'll explore:
* How transformer layers work together to generate meaningful outputs from text inputs.
* How embeddings and positional encodings work to represent language and maintain sequence information.
* How multi-head attention and self-attention distribute focus across different parts of the input.
* How feedforward layers and normalization help build context in the final model output.

By the end we should gain a strong understanding of transformer architectures and hands-on experience visualizing model transformations layer by layer.  

All code and presentation data will be openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/shauryashaurya/inside-a-transformer).  
  
I have the following outlin in mind for the tutorial:  
**Introduction to Transformer Models** (about 5 minutes)    
* Overview of the transformer architecture and its advantages over RNNs/LSTMs.    
* Quick overview of modern NLP tasks using transformers.
        
**Layer-by-Layer Overview of Transformer Components** (about 15 minutes)    
* Explanation of key components: embeddings, positional encodings, attention, and feedforward layers.    
* Detailed introduction to self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms.
        
**Visualizing the Flow of Data Through Layers** (about 20 minutes)    
* Track how embeddings are created and processed through attention layers.    
* Visualize the output changes after each feedforward and attention layer.
        
**Hands-On: Building and Visualizing Attention Weights** (about 15 minutes)    
* Step-by-step visualization of attention weights for tokens in a sentence.    
* Participants generate and interpret attention maps for their own queries.
        
**Understanding Feedforward Layers and Positional Encodings** (about 15 minutes)    
* Visualize the impact of positional encodings on maintaining sequence information.    
* Explore how feedforward layers refine and stabilize model outputs after attention layers.
        
**End-to-End Transformer Visualization: Input to Output** (about 15 minutes)    
* Walk through the entire process of input-to-output, showing intermediate visualizations.    
* Discuss how tokens influence final outputs, analyzing layer contributions to understanding.  
  
I find that this tutorial may be very interesting, esp cause it will be largely visual in nature, for anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of the magic behind LLMs and all the GenAI hype.    
  
Possible takeaways I see:  
* Comprehensive understanding of how transformers process data layer by layer.    
* Hands-on skills in visualizing and interpreting how LLMs handle attention, embeddings, and feedforward networks.    
* Possible insights into the practical uses of transformer models in NLP tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.
